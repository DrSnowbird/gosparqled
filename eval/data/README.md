# SPARQL queries extracted from logs

Those SPARQL queries were extracted from logs provided in the [USEWOD2013](http://usewod.org/) dataset. Each queries were then separated into categories depending on their complexity. The complexity of a SPARQL query depends on the number of triple patterns and on the number of star graphs. For example, Queries belonging to the category `1-2` have in total 3 triple patterns, two of which belong to a same entity, and the third to another entity. Queries in a file are separated by a line equal to `###`.

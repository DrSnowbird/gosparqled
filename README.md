# SPARQL Auto-Completion

Gosparqled provides a library for retrieving context-aware recommendations for a SPARQL query. The library is written in GO and is then translated into JavaScript using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

# Demo

The folder `demo/` shows how gosparqled can be used with other tools such as [YASR](https://github.com/YASGUI/YASR) and [YASQE](https://github.com/YASGUI/YASQE) in order to have a full-fledged SPARQL query editor with the added recommendation feature.
